# Buff Reposter Bot  

Buff Reposter Bot is a Discord bot that will repost the latest world buff timers from the [Skeram Discord](https://discord.gg/ng6CAEa). This is an extention of the work done by McDougald and the @world buff coordinators.  


## Getting Started  

You can add the bot to your server using this link-  
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=734570898929090590&permissions=67584&scope=bot 

The bot will need read messages and send messages permissions in order to operate in a channel.


## Bot Commands

The bot has two functions: !wb and !repost.

### !wb
This command will report the latest world buff timers.

### !repost
This command will create a post that automatically updates with the latest buff timers. Only the most recent !repost command in a server will be updated. The intention of this function is to be used in a channel where the !repost will always be visible.

### Help
To get help with the bot on discord **!brb** or **!buffreposterbot** commands can be used.
